# Basic Data Types in Python
## Objective Statement
*	Get insight into the data types in Python
*	Get insight into the formulas used for each data type using python
*	Get insight into the formulas used to call each data type in python
* Get insight into implementing formulas for each data type using python.

## Challenges
*	python is slower at translating code compared to other programming languages
*	sensitive Case Code

## Methodology
*	int formula
*	float formula
*	complex formula
*	string formula

## Benefit
*	Know the various formulas that are applied to each data type that will be used
*	know the implementation of formulas for each data type

## Expected Outcome
*	know numeric formulas using python
*	know string formulas using python
*	know the formula for displaying data types using python
*	know the formula for calling each data type using python
*	know the implementation of string and numeric formulas using python

## Data Type in Python 
1. Numeric:
Numeric is numbers type in Python, divided into 3:
   1. Integer (int) an integer
   2. Float = decimal number
   3. Complex = Formulation of x + yj, with x, is  a real number and y is an imaginary number
2. String:
String is a sequence of Unicode Characters. Declared in a single of double quotes. In Python, single or double quotes are considered the same. Strings of more than 1 line can be marked with 3 single quotes ''' or double """
